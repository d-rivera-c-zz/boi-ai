Core
-------
Config -> basic config stuff, like how much to log, how long to run, when to fail, where are the files,
          what problem and solution to use
Puppetmaster -> Controller of the basic and main functions
Logger


Problems
--------
Setup -> basic problem setup, normally taken from a file (num of cols, num of resources, space)
Soft restrictions
Hard restrictions
Function objective(?)



Solutions
--------
Config -> set up time running, numb of iterations, 
Type of function to use (penilize soft restrictions or no admit them)
Init mini solutions: ants, crmosoms, bees
Basically: run a cicle, deliver results
Save best solution
Check time pass or iterations pass


Representations
-----------
way to represent the problem, is not link to a problem itself or an algorithm

Examples
--------
1 to 3 examples for problems
