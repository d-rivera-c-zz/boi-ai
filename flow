Problems
-------
Core -> config
               -> sets implemented soft, hard, and rep (empty)
Core -> setup
               -> setproblem --> instanciate unique problem variables
                  rep.setStuff      --> fill in rep object with implemented soft, hard, problem

Repres
--------
Problem -> setRep -> 
                     set soft hard and objective -> define the functions for each, should be static
Problem -> setsoft
           sethard -> instanciated
           setproblem -> def of problem
           set space --> figure out way to show space rep
           
Solution
-----------
Core -> start up solution
Core -> config
Core -> setPRoblem (in solution)
Core -> run
Core -> wait for it to finish
